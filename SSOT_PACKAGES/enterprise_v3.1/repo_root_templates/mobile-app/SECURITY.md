# Security

## Non-negotiables
- No secrets in code or git history.
- PR-only workflow, main branch protected.
- RBAC enforced server-side for all privileged actions.
- Audit logs for sensitive actions (payments, refunds, RBAC changes).

## Reporting
Report security issues privately to the security owner.
