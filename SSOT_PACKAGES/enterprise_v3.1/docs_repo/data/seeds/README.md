# Seed Data (Yemen)

This folder includes an initial canonical seed set for Yemen governorates.
- File: `yemen_governorates.csv`

Add additional seed files as needed:
- cities.csv
- airlines.csv
- domestic_routes.csv

Rule: seeds must be deterministic and version-controlled in docs, and imported by backend scripts.
