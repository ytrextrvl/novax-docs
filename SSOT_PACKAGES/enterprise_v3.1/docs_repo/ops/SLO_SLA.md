# SLO/SLA (Initial Targets)

## API availability (monthly)
- Target: 99.5% minimum

## Latency (p95)
- Target: < 800ms for core endpoints (health, auth, booking create)

## Error rate
- Target: < 1% non-4xx for core endpoints

## Error budget policy
- If SLO is breached, prioritize reliability work over feature work until recovered.
